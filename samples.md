#Tester and Modell, 1997

$d\underline{U}=Td\underline{S}-Pd\underline{V}+\sum_1^n \mu_i dN_i$

$U=f(\underline{S},d\underline{V},N_1...N_n)$

$T = \left( \frac{\partial \underline{U}}{\partial S}\right)_{\underline{V},N}$

$\mu_i = \left( \frac{\partial \underline{U}}{\partial N_i}\right)_{\underline{S},\underline{V},N_{j[i]}}$

> In their prints, all d are italicized, there is some extra spacing between P and dV, the composition vector is represent by ... in S = f(), N used alone indicates all mole numbers are held constant
